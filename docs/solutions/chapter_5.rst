Exercise 5-1
------------
*main.c*

.. literalinclude:: ../../solutions/chapter_5/exercise-5_01/main.c
    :language: c
    :tab-width: 4

Compilation and run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ gcc main.c
    $ ./a.out
    > 3214
    Number: 3214
    > -2145
    Number: -2145
    > Hello
    Not a number!

Notes:

    * To keep familiarizing ourselves with the C standard library, 
      we use ``getc`` and ``ungetc``
      from ``<stdio.h>`` instead of 
      ``getch`` and ``ungetch`` defined in :ref:`exercise-4_0307`.
      One difference between them is that the
      ones from the standard library needs an additional 
      argument to specify where the input comes from 
      (``stdin`` in this case). 
      The solutions of exercises of :ref:`chapter-7` 
      are all about input and output.
    
    * ``ungetc`` may fail to push some ``c`` values. 
      Specifically, if the value of ``c`` equals 
      that of the macro ``EOF``, 
      the operation fails and the input stream is unchanged.
      This behaviour is alright, so
      we do not protect ``ungetc`` from receiving ``EOF`` and
      we also do not check for ``ungetc`` errors. 


Exercise 5-2
------------
*main.c*

.. literalinclude:: ../../solutions/chapter_5/exercise-5_02/main.c
    :language: c
    :tab-width: 4

Compilation and run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ gcc main.c
    $ ./a.out
    > 1424
    Number: 1424.000000
    > -12.134
    Number: -12.134000
    > .124
    Number: 0.124000
    > 123.
    Number: 123.000000
    > . 
    Not a number!

Notes:

    * Same considerations as :ref:`exercise-5_01`. 


Exercise 5-3
------------
*main.c*

.. literalinclude:: ../../solutions/chapter_5/exercise-5_03/main.c
    :language: c
    :tab-width: 4

Compilation and run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ gcc main.c
    $ ./a.out
    I saw her duck 
    for cover
    I saw her duck for cover

Notes:

    * We change the name of ``strcat`` to ``mystrcat`` 
      because there is a previous declaration of ``strcat``
      in ``<stdio>``.
    * It is responsibility of the caller to check that ``s`` 
      has enough space to concatenate the string ``t`` at its end.


Exercise 5-4
------------
*main.c*

.. literalinclude:: ../../solutions/chapter_5/exercise-5_04/main.c
    :language: c
    :tab-width: 4

Compilation and run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ gcc main.c
    $ ./a.out
    The way to start
    to start
    match: 1
    this is not real
    unreal
    match: 0

Notes:

    * We change the name of ``strcat`` to ``mystrcat`` 
      because there is a previous declaration of ``strcat``
      in ``<stdio>``.
    * It is responsibility of the caller to check that ``s`` 
      has enough space to concatenate the string ``t`` at its end.

Exercise 5-5
------------
*main.c*

.. literalinclude:: ../../solutions/chapter_5/exercise-5_05/main.c
    :language: c
    :tab-width: 4

Compilation and run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ gcc main.c
    $ ./a.out
    abcda
    abcda
    Comparison result: 0
    Concatenation result: abcdaabcda
    Copy results: abcda

Notes:

    * The description of the functions has been taken from the
      `man pages`_.

.. _exercise-5_06:

Exercise 5-6
------------
*main.c*

.. literalinclude:: ../../solutions/chapter_5/exercise-5_06/main.c
    :language: c
    :tab-width: 4

Compilation and run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ gcc main.c 
    $ ./a.out
    > 123.25 Hello there!
    > there
    019: 123.25 Hello there!
    rev: !ereht olleH 52.321
    int: 123
    str: 123
    pos: 13
    > 123.25
    ope: 123.25

Notes:

    * ``mygetline`` is a rewrite the one from :ref:`exercise-1_16` 
      but it does not store the ending ``\n`` char in the buffer. 
      ``atoi`` is a rewrite of the one defined in the standard library.
      ``itoa`` and ``reverse`` are rewrites of 
      the ones from :ref:`exercise-3_04`.
      ``strindex`` is a rewrite of the one defined in K&R page 69.
      ``getop`` is a rewrite of the one defined in K&R page 78.

Exercise 5-7
------------
*main.c*

.. literalinclude:: ../../solutions/chapter_5/exercise-5_07/main.c
    :language: c
    :tab-width: 4

The text input is from `sampletext.txt`_, we use redirection (``< sampletext.txt``)
to use the contents of this file as standard input when executing the program.

.. _`sampletext.txt`: https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1581/pg1581.txt

Compilation and run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ gcc main.c
    $ ./a.out < sampletext.txt
    mode    clocktics       nÂº lines
    ----    ---------       --------
     sta         5028          32768
     dyn         3061          32768

Notes:

    * ``mygetline`` is the same as the one in :ref:`exercise-5_06`.
    * We use ``getline`` from standard library to fill an array of pointer.
      We use ``mygetline`` to fill an array of arrays. 
      The former case is  ~1.6 faster, 
      this implies that ``getline`` from standard library
      is more efficient than ``mygetline``, even when it allocates
      memory dynamically. 
    * Notice the difference in the first argument of ``readline_static``
      and ``readline_dynamic``:

        * ``char **lineptr`` is used to pass an array of pointers.
        * ``char (*lines)[LINESIZE]`` is used to pass an array of arrays. 

      The parentheses in ``char (*lines)[LINESIZE]`` are 
      neccesary because ``char *lines[LINESIZE]`` is equivalent to 
      ``char *lines[]``, which is just the same as ``char **lines``
      (an array of pointers).

.. _`exercise-5_08`:

Exercise 5-8
------------
*main.c*

.. literalinclude:: ../../solutions/chapter_5/exercise-5_08/main.c
    :language: c
    :tab-width: 4

Compilation and run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ gcc main.c
    $ ./a.out 
    > year month day: 1991 6 19
    day of year: 170
    > year yearday: 1991 170
    date: 19/06/1991
    > year month day: 2023 13 5 
    error day_of_year: wrong input

Exercise 5-9
------------
*main.c*

.. literalinclude:: ../../solutions/chapter_5/exercise-5_09/main.c
    :language: c
    :tab-width: 4

Compilation and run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ gcc main.c
    $ ./a.out 
    > year month day: 1991 6 19
    day of year: 170
    > year yearday: 1991 170
    date: 19/06/1991
    > year yearday: 2025 400
    error month_day: wrong input

Notes:

    * The solution is exactly the same as :ref:`exercise-5_08` but
      we replace every subscriptor ``[]`` operator knowing that:

      .. code-block:: c

        a[b]
    
      is equivalent to:

      .. code-block:: c

        *(a + b)
